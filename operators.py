# Types of Python Operators
#
# Here's a list of different types of Python operators that we will learn in this tutorial.
#
# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment Operators
# Comparison Operators
# Logical Operators
# Bitwise Operators
# Special Operators
#1. Arithmetic Operators
sub = 3 - 5
print(sub)
add = sub + 6
print(add)
mult = add * 3
print(mult)
div = sub / 3
print(div)
#exponentiation ( power)
pow = 2 ** 3
print(pow)
#floor division
fdiv = 10 // 3
print(fdiv)
#modulus/remainder
mod = 10 % 3
print(mod)
#2. Python Assignment Operators
# Here's a list of different assignment operators available in Python.
z = 5
z += 3
print(z)

# 3. Python Comparison Operators
# Comparison operators compare two values/variables and return a boolean result: True or False. For example
# Here, the > comparison operator is used to compare whether a is greater than b or not.
#equal
t = 2 == 3
print(t)
#not equal
u = 4 != 4
print(u)
#greater than
r = 8 > 7
print(r)

#less than
i = 6<9
print(i)
# greater than or equal to
l = 7>=5
print(l)
#less than or equal to
q = 3<=5
print(q)

# 4. Python Logical Operators
#
# Logical operators are used to check whether an expression is True or False.
# They are used in decision-making. For example,
# Operator	Description	Example
# and	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and x < 10
# or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4
# not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)
